# Projects
The projects repository is a sampling of the work that I have completed.
Each branch contains an individual work. A description of each is as follows.

Bacteriophage-mutations: A program to collect many types of mutational data from bactiophages from phagesDB.

Predator/Prey: A graphical simulation of predator prey relationship given parameters than can be adjusted in the main function.

miRNA-classifier: A directory contains miRNA expression data from non-metastatic and metastatic tumors. This data is then processed and the top features are selected through information gain. Those top features are then used to create the classifier.
