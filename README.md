# Projects
The projects repository is a sampling of the work that I have completed.
Each folder contains an individual work. A description of each is as follows.

Bacteriophage-mutations: Collect many types of mutational data from bactiophages from phagesDB.

Predator/Prey: A graphical simulation of predator prey relationship given parameters than can be adjusted in the main function.

miRNA-classifier: A directory contains miRNA expression data from non-metastatic and metastatic tumors. This data is then processed and the top features are selected through information gain. Those top features are then used to create the classifier.

# Individual Works
predictive_models.R
This script generates a model to predict the mean RFFT value of individuals within a dataset. Also, different models are made to investigate the effect of female ornamentation in the ruby throat bird on their fitness.
